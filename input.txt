We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
And you wouldn't get this
From any other guy

I just want to tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around
and desert you

Never gonna make you cry
never gonns say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie
and hurt you

- Rick Astley "Never Gonna Give You Up"
